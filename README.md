  storage [options] <fileFolderAddress>           Visually display a contract's storage slots.
  
                                                  WARNING: sol2uml does not use the Solidity compiler so may differ with solc. A known example is fixed-sized arrays declared with an expression will fail to be sized.
  flatten <contractAddress>                       Merges verified source files for a contract from a Blockchain explorer into one local Solidity file.
  
                                                  In order for the merged code to compile, the following is done:
                                                  1. pragma solidity is set using the compiler of the verified contract.
                                                  2. All pragma solidity lines in the source files are commented out.
                                                  3. File imports are commented out.
                                                  4. "SPDX-License-Identifier" is renamed to "SPDX--License-Identifier".
                                                  5. Contract dependencies are analysed so the files are merged in an order that will compile.
  diff [options] <addressA> <fileFoldersAddress>  Compare verified Solidity code to another verified contract, a local file or local source files.
  
                                                  The results show the comparison of contract A to B.
                                                  The green sections are additions to contract B that are not in contract A.
                                                  The red sections are removals from contract A that are not in contract B.
                                                  The line numbers are from contract B. There are no line numbers for the red sections as they are not in contract B.

### Class usage

```
Usage: sol2uml class [options] <fileFolderAddress>

Generates a UML class diagram from Solidity source code.

Arguments:
  fileFolderAddress                file name, folder(s) or contract address.
                                  When a folder is used, all *.sol files in that folder and all sub folders are used.
                                  A comma-separated list of files and folders can also be used. For example,
                                        sol2uml contracts,node_modules/@openzeppelin
                                  If an Ethereum address with a 0x prefix is passed, the verified source code from Etherscan will be used. For example
                                        sol2uml 0x79fEbF6B9F76853EDBcBc913e6aAE8232cFB9De9

### Storage usage

```
Usage: sol2uml storage [options] <fileFolderAddress>

Visually display a contract's storage slots.

WARNING: sol2uml does not use the Solidity compiler so may differ with solc. A known example is fixed-sized arrays declared with an expression will fail to be sized.

Arguments:
  fileFolderAddress               file name, folder(s) or contract address.
                                  When a folder is used, all *.sol files in that folder and all sub folders are used.
                                  A comma-separated list of files and folders can also be used. For example
                                        sol2uml contracts,node_modules/openzeppelin-solidity
                                  If an Ethereum address with a 0x prefix is passed, the verified source code from Etherscan will be used. For example
                                        sol2uml 0x79fEbF6B9F76853EDBcBc913e6aAE8232cFB9De9

Options:
  -c, --contract <name>           Contract name in the local Solidity files. Not needed when using an address as the first argument as the contract name can be derived from Etherscan.
  -cf, --contractFile <filename>  Filename the contract is located in. This can include the relative path to the desired file.
  -d, --data                      Gets the values in the storage slots from an Ethereum node. (default: false)
  -s, --storage <address>         The address of the contract with the storage values. This will be different from the contract with the code if a proxy contract is used. This is not needed if `fileFolderAddress` is an address and the contract is not proxied.
  -u, --url <url>                 URL of the Ethereum node to get storage values if the `data` option is used. (default: "http://localhost:8545", env: NODE_URL)
  -bn, --block <number>           Block number to get the contract storage values from. (default: "latest")
  -a, --array <number>            Number of slots to display at the start and end of arrays. (default: "2")
  -hx, --hideExpand <variables>   Comma-separated list of storage variables to not expand. That's arrays, structs, strings or bytes.
  -hv, --hideValue                Hide storage slot value column. (default: false)
  -h, --help                      display help for command
```

### Flatten usage

```
Usage: sol2uml flatten <contractAddress>

Merges verified source files for a contract from a Blockchain explorer into one local Solidity file.

In order for the merged code to compile, the following is done:
1. pragma solidity is set using the compiler of the verified contract.
2. All pragma solidity lines in the source files are commented out.
3. File imports are commented out.
4. "SPDX-License-Identifier" is renamed to "SPDX--License-Identifier".
5. Contract dependencies are analysed so the files are merged in an order that will compile.

Arguments:
  contractAddress  Contract address in hexadecimal format with a 0x prefix.

Options:
  -h, --help       display help for command
```

### Diff usage

```
Usage: sol2uml diff [options] <addressA> <addressB or comma-separated folders>

Compare verified contract code on Etherscan-like explorers to another verified contract, a local file or multiple local files.

The results show the comparison of contract A to B.
The green sections are additions to contract B that are not in contract A.
The red sections are removals from contract A that are not in contract B.
The line numbers are from contract B. There are no line numbers for the red sections as they are not in contract B.

Arguments:
  addressA                   Contract address in hexadecimal format with a 0x prefix of the first contract
  fileFoldersAddress         Location of the contract source code to compare against. Can be a filename, comma-separated list of local folders or a contract address. Examples:
    "flat.sol" will compare against a local file called "flat.sol". This must be used when address A's verified source code is a single, flat file.
    ".,node_modules" will compare against local files under the current working folder and the node_modules folder. This is used when address A's verified source code is multiple files.
    0x1091588Cc431275F99DC5Df311fd8E1Ab81c89F3 will compare against the verified source code from Etherscan.

Options:
  -s, --summary              Only show a summary of the file differences (default: false)
  -af --aFile <value>        Limit code compare to contract A source file with the full path and extension as displayed in the file summary (default: compares all source files)
  -bf --bFile <value>        Contract B source file with the full path and extension as displayed in the file summary. Used if aFile is specified and the source file has been renamed (default: aFile if specified)
  -bn, --bNetwork <network>  Ethereum network which maps to a blockchain explorer for contract B if on a different blockchain to contract A. Contract A uses the `network` option (default: value of `network` option) (choices: "mainnet", "goerli", "sepolia", "polygon", "arbitrum", "avalanche", "bsc", "crono", "fantom", "moonbeam", "optimism", "gnosis", "celo", "base")
  -be, --bExplorerUrl <url>  Override the `bNetwork` option with custom blockchain explorer API URL for contract B if on a different blockchain to contract A. Contract A uses the `explorerUrl` (default: value of `explorerUrl` option)
  -bk, --bApiKey <key>       Blockchain explorer API key for contract B if on a different blockchain to contract A. Contract A uses the `apiKey` option (default: value of `apiKey` option)
  --flatten                  Flatten into a single file before comparing. Only works when comparing two verified contracts, not to local files (default: false)
  --saveFiles                Save the flattened contract code to the filesystem when using the `flatten` option. The file names will be the contract address with a .sol extension (default: false)
  -l, --lineBuffer <value>   Minimum number of lines before and after changes (default: 4)
  -h, --help                 display help for command
```

```

To generate a diagram of all Solidity files under the `contracts` and `node_modules/@openzeppelin` folders. The output will be `contracts.svg` and `contracts.png` files in the working folder.

```bash
sol2uml class ./contracts,node_modules/@openzeppelin -f all -v
```

To generate a diagram of all Solidity files under the working folder ignoring and files under the `solparse`, `@solidity-parser` and `ethlint` folders, which will be under the `node_modules` folder.

# UML Class Diagram Syntax

Good online resources for learning UML

-   [UML 2 Class Diagramming Guidelines](http://www.agilemodeling.com/style/classDiagram.htm)
-   [Creating class diagrams with UML](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/class-diagrams-with-uml/)

## Terminology differences

A Solidity variable becomes an attribute in UML and a Solidity function becomes an operation in UML.

## Stereotypes

### Class stereotypes

-   Interface
-   Abstract - if any of the contract's functions are abstract, the class will have an Abstract stereotype. Child contracts of abstract contracts that do not implement all the abstract functions are currently not marked as Abstract.
-   Library

### Operator stereotypes

-   event
-   modifier
-   abstract - if there is no function body on a contract, the operator is marked as abstract. Operators on an Interface do not have an abstract stereotype as all operators are abstract.
-   fallback - abstract fallback functions will just have an abstract stereotype.
-   payable - payable fallback functions will just have a fallback stereotype.

## UML Associations

Lines:

-   Solid lines for
    -   link the contract types of storage (state) variables. This can be linked to contracts, interfaces, libraries or file level structs and enums.
    -   generalisations of contracts and abstract contracts.
    -   aggregated contract level structs and enums.
-   Dashed lines for
    -   generalisations of interfaces.
    -   types of memory variables.

Heads/Tails:

-   An empty triangle head for generalisations of contracts, interfaces and abstract contracts.
-   An open arrow head for storage or memory variable dependencies
-   A diamond tail for aggregations of contract level structs and enums

## Storage diagram

See more storage slot diagrams [here](./examples/storage/README.md).

# Styling Colors

The colors use by the diagrams can be configured using the `backColor`, `shapeColor`, `fillColor` and `textColor` options.
sol2uml uses the [X11 color scheme](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/colors.html#x11) for named colors.
Other color formats like Red-Green-Blue (RGB) can also be used. For example, #ffffff for white and #000000 for black.
See [Graphviz color](https://graphviz.org/docs/attr-types/color/) documentation for more details.

Here's an example using the color options
```
sol2uml storage -sc deeppink -tc #ffffff -fc dimgrey -bc black 0xfCc00A1e250644d89AF0df661bC6f04891E21585
```

# About

This is a rewrite of the Richard Ramos's [solidity-diagram-gen](https://github.com/richard-ramos/solidity-diagram-gen) tool which no longer works as it uses [solidity-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solidity-parser/v/0.4.0) which cannot handle newer Solidity syntax like `constructor`.

sol2uml uses [@solidity-parser/parser](https://github.com/solidity-parser/parser) which is maintained by the Solidity tool community lead by Franco Victorio (@fvictorio). This is a fork of Federico Bond's (GitHub @federicobond) [solidity-parser-antlr](https://github.com/federicobond/solidity-parser-antlr). The logic to generate the dot syntax has been rewritten and different UML syntax is now used to Richard Ramos's original implementation.

The [Solidity language grammar](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/miscellaneous.html#language-grammar) is published with each major release.

The diagrams are generated using [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/) which uses [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) to render a [Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) file. [Graphviz Online](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) allows dot files to be edited and rendered into a SVG dynamically.
